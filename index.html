<u>title</u>: Reading and Reasoning with Vector Representations<br />
<u>abstract</u>: In recent years, vector representations of knowledge have become popular in NLP and beyond. They have at least two core benefits: reasoning with (low-dimensional) vectors tends to lead to better generalisation, and usually scales very well. But they raise their own set of questions: What type of inferences do they support? How can they capture asymmetry? How can explicit background knowledge be injected into vector-based architectures? How can we provide âproofsâ that justify predictions? In this talk, I sketch some initial answers to some of these questions based on our recent work. In particular, I will illustrate how a vector space can simulate the workings of logic. <br />

He is also the head of research at Bloomsbury AI and an Allen Distinguished Investigator.

                                                          <u>abstract</u>: Pat Hayesâs naÃ¯ve physics papers were highly influential in the 1980s and 90s, inaugurating the field of qualitative reasoning, inspiring the CYC project, and laying the foundations of the semantic web. Back then, the underlying motive for studying common sense physics was the development of human-level AI. But this grandiose aim slowly faded into the background of mainstream AI research, and has only recently been revived, under the new moniker of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Nowadays, AGI is being pursued through the methodology of neural networks, an approach that was anathama to the logic-oriented common sense reasoning community that arose in the 1980s. In this talk I will examine the importance of common sense physics for contemporary AGI research, highlighting a number of insights from AIâs past that are still relevant today.<br />

<h3>Call for Papers<br />
Thirteenth International Symposium on Commonsense Reasoning (Commonsense-2017)</h3>

<p>We invite submissions to Commonsense-2017, to be held in London at the University College London, November 6-8, 2017.</p>
 
<p>Endowing computers with common sense is one of the major long-term goals of Artificial Intelligence research. Commonsense knowledge and reasoning are relevant for many applications of current interest. Examples include robot and human collaboration, transparent machine-learning systems that can explain their conclusions, social media and story understanding software, and dialogue systems. The recent resurgence of interest in commonsense reasoning reflects a wider societal reaction to current technological advances, such as the fact that ânext year a law will come into operation in [EU] member states which gives everyone a right to an explanation of any decision affecting them that has been reached algorithmicallyâ [Guardian newspaper, 14 April 2017].</p>
 
<p>Approaches to acquiring commonsense knowledge and performing commonsense reasoning may incorporate semantics-based representation and inference, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and/or cognitive science. The symposium aims to encourage cross-fertilization between these and other techniques. The synthesis of multiple approaches is challenging, but could jump-start progress on many outstanding problems of commonsense reasoning.</p>

<p>We welcome a wide variety of submissions, including formal results, experimental results, demos, surveys,  evaluations and comparisons of different approaches, and papers on methodological issues. While mathematical logic has traditionally been the primary lingua franca of the Symposium, we welcome all relevant and rigorous approaches to automating commonsense knowledge and reasoning. </p>
 
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Semantics-based representations for specific commonsense domains, such as:<br />
 - Time, change, action, causality<br />
 - Commonsense physical and spatial reasoning<br />
 - Legal, biological, medical, and other scientific reasoning incorporating elements of common sense<br />
 - Mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions<br />
 - Social activities and relationships</li>

<li>Inference methods for commonsense reasoning, such as:<br />
 - Logic programming <br />
 - Probabilistic, heuristic, and approximate reasoning<br />
 - Nonmonotonic reasoning, belief revision and argumentation<br />
 - Abductive and inductive reasoning<br />
 - Textual Entailment</li>
 
<li>Methods for creating commonsense knowledge bases, such as:<br />
 - Statistical and corpus-based techniques, including both traditional machine learning and deep learning<br />
 - Crowdsourcing<br />
 - Hand-crafting domain theories<br />
 - Hybrid methods</li>
                                                                                                                                                               	
<li>Applications of commonsense reasoning,  especially interdisciplinary research in the following areas:<br />
 - Natural language understanding (understanding discourse, question answering, semantic parsing)<br />
 - Image understanding<br />
 - Cognitive robotics and planning<br />
 - Web-based applications (search, internet of things)<br />
 - Support technologies (computer-aided instruction, home automation)<br />

<li>Discussions of the science of commonsense reasoning research, including:<br />
 - Meta-theorems about commonsense theories and techniques<br />
 - Relation to other fields, such as philosophy, linguistics, cognitive psychology, game theory, and economics<br />
 - Challenge problem sets and benchmarking</li>
</ul>
 
<p>By default accepted papers will be published shortly after the symposium in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings series. Authors may however opt out of publishing in CEUR, e.g. if they wish to publish their paper at another venue. All accepted papers will be made available on the commonsensereasoning.org website for the duration of the symposium. A special issue of Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, which will include selected and extended papers from Commonsense-2017, is currently planned; journal submissions will be due in winter 2018.
