<p><font size=+1><a name="001">Q1. </a><b>Workshop discussion</b>:</font><p>
<p>There were a number of comments by several participants on the question
of chronological minimization vs chronological ignorance, and the
author's reference to Shoham's work. The bottom line seemed to be that
we have to make distinction between <em>chronological minimization of 
change</em> which was proposed by several authors concurrently in the
flurry of the Yale shooting problem, and <em>chronological minimization
of ignorance</em> which was developed by Yoav Shoham in his thesis and subsequent
book. The early formulations of chron.min. of change were by Shoham
(conference article), Kautz, and Lifschitz.
<p>
Several authors have investigated chron.min. of change in more
recent work, whereas chron.min. of ignorance has not been further used.
There are also indications that the latter gives incorrect results for
many simple examples. However, the present article does seem to be using
chron.min. of ignorance.

<p><font size=+1><a name="002">Q2. </a><b><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~erisa/index-eng.html">Erik Sandewall</a></b>:</font><p>
<p>I have objections to some parts of your argumentation at the beginning
of the article, and finally some questions.
<p>
In the article, you write that I have "attacked" Shoham's causal theories
for technical reasons, and that I "went on to propose increasingly more
complex forms of chronological minimization", with reference to my 1994 
book. This is inaccurate, since my
approach in <b><font color="#005588">[mb-Sandewall-94]</font></b> as well as elsewhere has been to compare and
analyse different entailment methods, rather than advocating one of them
over another. In particular, the book contains assessments for about
one dozen such methods, several of which have nothing to do with
chronological minimization. The set includes both a number of methods
that had previously been introduced by others, and methods that
naturally arose in the course of the work.
<p>
In the article, you
also object to the use of filtering, where observations are imposed
after the minimization of changes (or of discontinuities) has occurred.
This method is now fairly widely used; it was adopted by Lifschitz
under the name of nested circumscription. Your objection is that it is
complex and that it does not have any counterpart in everyday causal
reasoning. However, if simplicity is an issue, then I can offer it
through PMON, also defined in <b><font color="#005588">[mb-Sandewall-94]</font></b>, which is about as
simple as you can get. 
<p>
With respect to having a counterpart in everyday causal reasoning,
this introduces an issue that the book makes no attempt and no 
claim to address. The criticism is therefore irrelevant. The analyses of
chron.min. as well as of PMON in the book only consider their 
use for the plain inertia problem; it is nowhere claimed that the 
analysis would apply for any kind of causal reasoning.
<p>
I am afraid that at this point you share in a habit that is quite
common in our field, namely to criticize an approach X only because it 
fails to handle some example correctly, and regardless of whether it was
<em>claimed</em> or <em>intended</em> to handle that case. In other words, you
can be criticized for not solving all the problems at once. This style
of discussion may be understandable in those cases where the author has 
not specified what class of problems his approach <em>is</em> claimed to solve 
in the first place, of if the author has made excessive claims. However, 
since I have tried to make a point of specifying what topics I am 
addressing at each point, I find your objection misdirected.
<p>
With respect to "everyday reasoning", please see my position statement
(forthcoming) in the panel discussion.
<p>
These were my objections to your argumentation. Finally, a few questions:
<p>
1.  In view of your reference to "everyday causal reasoning" in the
context of my work, is the logic proposed in your article intended
to match such reasoning with respect to both the structure of the 
inference process and the conclusions obtained? In particular, what
sense does it then make to treat prediction and explanation as two
different reasoning processes, as you propose to? After all, in
everyday reasoning we are able to combine the two seamlessly.
<p>
2.  In your article, you introduce the predicates <em>Aff</em> and
<em>Qual</em> to be used in representing inertia and change. How are
these related to similar predicates previously proposed by others?
The <em>Aff</em> predicate seems to be occlusion, once again reinvented,
and your general inertia rule seems to be the same as the nochange 
axiom schema used in PMON (originally introduced by McCarthy I 
believe).
<p>
3.  The most important difference between your approach and what 
has been proposed before appears to be that you are using a
threevalued logic; is this correct?  If so, and in view of the
similarity of other aspects of the approach to previous work, what
advantage do you derive from switching to a three-valued logic for
this purpose?
