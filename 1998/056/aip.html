<p>I have questions about your section 6, "Applying Point-Sensitive
Circumscription to Theories of Action", which I can not make sense of.
You first review the formulation of PCM (Prototypical Chronological
Minimization) in pointwise circumscription, and then write (p. 71):
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em>

  We do not claim that Point-Sensitive Circumscription can formalize
  the entire K-IA ontological class, but that it can take you farther
  than Pointwise circumscription can.
</em></font></td></tr></table>

<p>
Let me briefly review the relevant aspect of Features and fluents,
in order to put what follows into context.
The K-IA ontological class allows for
scenarios with nondeterministic actions, actions with extended duration
in time and internal structure, and all combinations of prediction and
postdiction. It does not model causality or other forms of ramification,
nor concurrency, etc.
<p>
For this K-IA class, we have studied a number of <em>entailment methods</em>,
each of which can then be reexpressed in e.g. pointwise circumscription.
PCM is one of those entailment methods. Each of them is defined in
terms of preference criteria or other selection criteria on models, 
and it is these criteria that may be translated e.g. to circumscription
as a way of proceeding towards an implementation. For each entailment
method, there is also an assessment of range of applicability. This
assessment is model-theoretic, and is independent of the choice
of implementation method.
<p>
In this framework it is perfectly reasonable, as you do, to evaluate
a variant of circumscription with respect to whether or not it is
capable of expressing a particular entailment method, or even a 
collection of them. This makes much more sense than analyzing
circumscription variants directly in terms of test examples, since
then so much depends on the choice of axiomatization.
<p>
Though I agree with your methodology up to that point, I do not 
understand the concrete case where it is applied. You only discuss
how PCM is rendered in variants of circumscription, but Doherty has 
already shown how to express PCM in pointwise circumscription.
If your variant of circumscription is able to handle more examples
correctly within the range of K-IA, it could therefore only be
because it were an inaccurate rendering of PCM.
<p>
Also, although the range of applicability of PCM is only a limited
part of K-IA, there are other entailment methods such as PMON
which are correct for K-IA, and which can also be expressed in
pointwise circumscription following Doherty. This makes it even
more strange how point-sensitive circumscription can do something
that pointwise circumscription can not, with respect to the K-IA
class.
<p>
You also discuss a simple case of ramification using the duality
between the <em>dead</em> and <em>alive</em> properties. This of course is
not within K-IA, as you also observe. However, there are certainly
known methods that handle such simple ramifications (as well somewhat
less trivial ones) correctly and that have been expressed or 
re-expressed using pointwise circumscription.
<p>
Could you help me understand your contribution in these respects?

[For the reader: PCM is defined roughly as follows (see
<b><font color="#005588">[s-Gabbay-94-999]</font></b> for more details):
Interpretations <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;<tt><font size=+1>&#171;</font></tt><sub><font size=-1><em>pcm</em></font></sub>&#160;<em>I</em><em>'</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> iff <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>M</em><tt>&#160;=&#160;</tt><em>M</em><em>'</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> 
(the objects are the same) and there is <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>&#160;</font></b></formula> s.t.
<ol>

<li>for all <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><tt>&#160;&lt;&#160;</tt><em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>&#160;</font></b></formula>,  <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>R</em>(<em>t</em>)<tt>&#160;=&#160;</tt><em>R</em><em>'</em>(<em>t</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula>  
(the fluents are identical in <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> and <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>I</em><em>'</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> before <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>&#160;</font></b></formula>) and
<li><formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>breakset</em><b>(<em>I</em>,&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>)<tt>&#160;c&#160;</tt></b><em>breakset</em><b>(<em>I</em><em>'</em>,&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>)&#160;</font></b></formula> 
  (the fluent value changes from <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub><em>-</em><em>1</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> to <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>&#160;</font></b></formula>
    in <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> are a subset of the appropriate changes in <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>I</em><em>'</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>).
</ol>

Then the set of 
models for PCM is <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>S</em><sub><font size=-1><em>pcm</em></font></sub>(<em>T</em>)<tt>&#160;=&#160;</tt></b><em>Min</em><b>(&#160;<tt><font size=+1>&#171;</font></tt><sub><font size=-1><em>pcm</em></font></sub>&#160;,&#160;<em>models</em>(<em>T</em>))&#160;</font></b></formula>.]
<p>
Pointwise Circumscription (I shall abbreviate it here Pt-Circ) is a 
special case of
Point-Sensitive Circumscription (abbreviated here Pt-Sens), and so PCM can
be expressed in Pt-Sens the same way 
<b><font color="#005588">[c-ictl-94-82]</font></b>
shows with Pt-Circ. However,
Doherty and Lukaszewicz showed that Pt-Circ expresses PCM only for the 
ontological
class Kp-IAex, in which no observations later than time <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><tt>&#160;=&#160;</tt><em>0</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> are allowed. 
The example
I give in the paper shows that Pt-Sens may be able to express PCM 
outside Kp-IA
(notice that the example I give falls within K-IA, as the 
"ramification" is accounted
for by domain constraints (observations for time later than 0)). 
I did not prove a higher lower-bound, though. I just showed cases 
outside Kp-IA where Pt-Circ fails and Pt-Sens succeeds.
<p>
You then write

My claim was that we may be able to avoid filtering (the way

Although the simple example I gave is within K-IA, I support the

<p>Hi Eyal,
<p>
A few comments regarding your paper and then a few regarding your 
comments to Erik. First, your paper:
<p>
First off, I think your notion of Pt-Sens circumscription is an
interesting technical result, but wonder about its widespread
applicability (see comments below). The "counter-intuitive example"
(your description) you provide as a reason for proposing Pt-Sens 
circumscription would appear to be more counter-intuitive in the 
way the policy is set up rather than in the result. The reason 
for introducing pointwise circumscription in the first place <b>is</b>
so that one can vary <b>parts</b> of an extension while fixing other 
parts. To introduce a policy where you vary the whole extension 
of the predicate you are minimizing strikes me as being a bit 
extreme. But, I suppose one could find more intuitive 
"counter-intuitive" examples to prove your case, which do not
violate one's sense of proper use of pointwise circumscription
(if there is such a thing!)
<p>
You also state in section 7 that
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> pointwise circumscription is sufficient if we restrict ourselves 
 to deterministic actions and to cases in which there are no domain 
 constraints.
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>Well, the K-IA class deals with non-deterministic actions just fine
and in the case of PMON, or its extension PMON(RC) discussed below,
where ramification can be dealt with using a combination of domain
and dependency constraints, syntactic characterizations for both can be
defined using pointwise circumscription. Although it is computationally 
more feasible to choose a different type of circumscription. You can 
check my ecai94 paper or the paper by gustafsson and myself in kr96. 
In fact, I think you attended the ijcai97 workshop where I 
demonstrated PMON(RC).
<p>
In conclusion, I enjoyed the first part of the paper, but I'd think 
the second part regarding applications to logics of action and change 
needs some more work (By the way, I have only read your workshop draft, 
so you may have fixed things since.)
<p>
Now some comments about your and Erik's interaction:
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> Pointwise Circumscription (I shall abbreviate it here Pt-Circ) is a

 <b><font color="#005588">[c-ictl-94-82]</font></b> shows with Pt-Circ. However, Doherty and Lukaszewicz 
 showed that Pt-Circ expresses PCM only for the ontological class 
 Kp-IAex, in which no observations later than time <formula></em></font><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em><sub><em>0</em></sub>&#160;</font></b><font color="BROWN"><em></formula> are allowed.
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>The point is that PCM is limited to the class Kp-IAex, and Pt-Circ
was used to provide a syntactic characterization of PCM's minimization 
policy, not that Pt-Circ is inherently unable to represent classes 
which subsume Kp-IAex.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> My claim was that we may be able to avoid filtering (the way
 <b><font color="#005588">[c-ictl-94-82]</font></b> does) in grasping K-IA.
</em></font></td></tr></table>I did not prove that either. Future work?...
<p>
Why would you want to avoid filtering? And, if there is a legitimate
reason, I would imagine you'd want to replace pointwise circumscription
with a more computationally efficient policy than a generalization of 
generalized pointwise circumscription which is what Pt-Sens appears to
be.
<p>

<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>In the KR96 paper by Gustafsson and myself, we introduce a
straightforward technique to extend PMON, which is assessed correct
for the K-IA class, so that it deals with a broad class of problems 
associated with ramification. This logic PMON(RC) subsumes K-IA.
The minimization policy is practically the same as PMON and can
trivially be defined using pointwise circumscription, although we
use standard predicate circumscription (in fact predicate completion).
In fact, we model both the stuffy room example from Winslett and the
alive/walking example in the paper. There are many more examples
that you can test using the VITAL tool which I demonstrated at IJCAI97.
