<p> A fairly large part of your work is devoted to the time 
structure. Then, under "future work" you mention addressing the 
topic of continuous change. Won't you then have to use the real 
numbers (or something similar) as time structure?
<p><font size=+1><a name="003">A1. </a><b><a href="http://www.gre.ac.uk./~j.ma">Jixin Ma</a></b> (26.1):</font><p>
<p>Yes, though it is not necessary to directly use the real 
numbers as the time structure. In fact, a general time theory based 
on both points and intervals is proposed previously (The Computer 
Journal 37(2), 1994, pp.114-123). With the corresponding density 
axioms, it seems appropriate for addressing continuous change.

<p>In this case, why don't you introduce them at once, even for 
the present work?  Is there some essential aspect of the present 
results that you are going to lose when you proceed to continuous 
change?

<p>First of all, the approch addressing both moments and points as 
primitive is proposed in the paper in order to overcome the 
so-called Dividing Instant Problem, i.e., the problem in specifying 
if intervals is "closed"/"open" at their ending points in the case 
intervals are constructed out of points. It is argued again and again 
by many researchers that no solution is satisfactory to the question 
of what preconception about the closed/open nature of intervals 
should be taken:
<ul>

<li>If all intervals include their ending-points, then 
adjacent intervals would have ending-points in common. Hence, if two 
adjacent intervals correspond to a given fluent and its negation, 
respectively, there will be a point at which the fluent is both true 
and false. 
<p>
<li>Similarly, if all intervals don't include their 
ending-points, there will be points at which the truth or falsity of 
some fluents are undefined. 
<p>
<li>Another approach is to take point-based 
intervals as semi-open (e.g., all intervals include their left 
ending-points, and exclude their right ones) so that they may sit 
conveniently next to one another. However, on the one hand, since 
this approach insists that every interval contains only a single 
ending-point, the choice of which ending-point of intervals should be 
included/excluded seems arbitrary, and hence unjustifiable and 
artificial. On the other hand, although the approach may offer a 
solution to some practical questions, there are some other critical 
questions which remain problematical. The fundamental reason is that 
in a system where time intervals are all taken as semi-open, it will 
be difficult to represent time points in a consistent structure so 
that they can stand between intervals conveniently. 
</ul>

<p>
There are three reasons of taking a discrete time structure: 
<p>
1. It is simple and adequate for many practical applications. 
<p>
2. It is noted that, if time intervals are addressed as temporal 
objects which can be associated with fluents by  meta-predicates such 
as "HOLDS" or "TRUE", one shall face the possibility that a fluent 
might be neither true nor false throughout some interval. In the 
worst case, the so-called intermingling problem may arise, that is 
the possibility of a fluent changing its truth value infinitely often 
in an interval with a finite duration. This will lead to some 
difficulties in characterising the relationships between the negation 
of a fluent and the negation of involved sentances. 
<p>
The approach that 
addresses intervals as a finite ordered union of points/moments 
sucessfully overcomes (or at least bypasses) such a problem. For the
purpose of modelling continuous change, it seems necessary (this 
maybe arguable) to extend such a discrete time model to a dense one. 
However, in this case, some careful treatments have to be taken for 
dealing with the Intermingling Problem.
<p>
3. Since times are explicitly addressed in the formalism, the 
corresponding Frame Problem would become more difficult to be handled
if the time structure is modelled as dense in the first place. Hence,
the strategy is to tackle the simple case (that is, the discrete
model) first, then to extend the idea to the general case.
