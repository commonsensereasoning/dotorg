<p>You mentioned in your talk that Lin's use of the mnemonic "causes"
tends to be misleading. I agree with this, and indeed the observation
from our group to his work was that it was more or less a reformulation
of what had already been done using occlusion. However, I wonder
if there isn't a similar problem with your use of the mnemonic "do".
When you characterize the <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Toss</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> event using formulae such as
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(</b><em>Heads</em><b>(<em>1</em>),&#160;</b><em>true</em><b>)&#160;</font></b></formula>, then who is it that is doing something?
<p>
<p><font size=+1><a name="003">A1. </a><b><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~pdg">Peter Gr&uuml;nwald</a></b> (19.2):</font><p>
<p>Yes and no. `Yes' in the sense that the word `Do' may be misleading too
- - indeed, nobody needs to be doing something when a coin falls on the
table. `No' in the sense that I am very explicit in my article about the
`physics' of Do: I state precisely what has to happen in a domain in
order for <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>B</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> to be the case in that domain; no such statement
about <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> can be found in Lin's work. 
<p>
Namely, <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>B</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> means that an intervention takes place that sets the
value of <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>X</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> to <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>B</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>. A more appropiate term might indeed be <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Set</em><b>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>B</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> or
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Intervention</em><b>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>B</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula>. I used <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> to stay close to Pearl's notation, 
see <b><font color="#005588">[c-tark-96-51]</font></b>.
<p>
Lin's use of the predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> has not such a clear interpretation.
It gets an implicit interpretation by the axioms it is involved in
(like <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>s</em>,&#160;</b><em>True</em><b>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt></b><em>Holds</em><b>(<em>X</em>,&#160;<em>s</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula>) but it is not a priori clear what
has to be the case in the domain of interest in order for <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> to be
true.
<p>
In other words, we do not really know what we are trying to model by the
predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> - that's the essential difference with <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>.

<p>The difference is that it is not clear what exactly has to happen (in

<p>
is how Lin formalizes the suitcase domain. This translates to
`if both switches of the famous suitcase are up, then it is caused 
to be open'
<p>
But is the suitcase caused to be open by the mere fact that the switches
are up? Shouldn't it rather be: `the suitcase is caused to be open only
if the the switches are <em>put</em> in the up position? One may argue about
this - as one may argue about the appropiateness of lots and lots of
uses of the word `caused' in everyday language: in different situations
the word can stand for different things. Because of this ambiguity, I
argue, theories of action in which `caused' is used as an atomic
concept, <em>intended to be used whenever we use the word `caused' in
everyday language</em>, will run into trouble at some point. 
<p>
I think the concept of `intervention' suffers no such ambiguity. Suppose
I give you a description of the complete state of a reasoning domain at
time <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> (or in a situation <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>s</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>, if you like). Then you will usually be able
to say whether or not an intervention takes place at that point in time/
in that situation. It will not always be clear whether or not
something is `caused to have truth value <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>v</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>' at that point in time/ in
that situation. In other words, to put it very bluntly, `I know what I'm
modelling' whereas Lin does not.

<p>Peter, Vladimir, and Fangzhen
<p>
(The following combines answers to your respective comments to the 
discussion)
<p>
A common feature in much of the recent work is the use of an operator
that "enables" change, that is, the operator excepts a feature from
the requirement or the preference of persistence. The neutral term exception 
operator then covers both occlusion (often written as a predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>X</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>), 
Vladimir's "release" operator, Lin's "Caused" operator, and Peter's "Do" 
operator, and also e.g. the negation of the "persistent" operator of 
del Val and Shoham. (An important early reference that articulates the use 
of such an operator in a general way is Hector Geffner's paper at KR 1989,
<b><font color="#005588">[c-kr-89-137]</font></b>).
<p>
Anyway, when such logics are used and one is to express that a certain 
"cause" has a certain "effect", then one has in principle three 
possibilities:
<ul>

<li> The antecedent may refer to the current (new) value of some fluent
    or combination of fluents.
<li> The antecedent may refer to the fact that the value of some fluent 
    has changed. For generality, we can view this as a "discontinuity" 
    so that it allows both continuous-valued and discrete-valued fluents.
    Possibly the antecedent refers to a combination of current value(s)
    and current change(s) in fluents. (For continuous change, we also
    have the case where a continuously changing fluent has reached
    a certain value, that is, a discontinuity of equality).
<li> The antecedent may refer to the exception operator, possibly in
    combination with current fluent value(s). This is what happens
    if "Caused implies Caused".
</ul>

All of these are instances of what Fangzhen calls "fluent-based causes",
that is, causal relationships that only refer to values or changes of 
fluents, but not to the occurrence of actions. 
<p>
Peter, you seem to argue that (3) is the right approach, and quote
Fangzhen as using (1); Vladimir defends this with the reference to Searle. 
However, I observe that in his 1995 article, Fangzhen allows both (1) 
and (3). The general form of causal rules in his formula (16) allows 
one or more uses of the exception operator in the antecedent. However,
example (22) does not use it, apparently in order to assure that the 
minimization will be computable by Clark completion. Isn't that a 
problem in your (Peter's) case as well?
<p>
Vladimir, I don't see why everything that's called "causation" in
natural language has to be handled with the same logical devices.
Seconding Peter's point of view, why can't we use one formalization for 
causation chains, where one change causes another change, and another 
formalization for static dependencies? The <em>causal propagation 
semantics</em> that I introduced in my KR 1996 paper
<b><font color="#005588">[c-kr-96-99]</font></b> and used for 
assessments of several approaches to ramification, is exactly a way of 
formalizing those cases where one change causes another. The kinds of 
situations that Searle refers to, or the early "dumbbell" example 
of Ginsberg and Smith represent arguably another class of phenomenona.
<p>
For causal propagation of change, there remains the choice between
approaches (2) and (3) above: should the rule trigger on the fact that
change actually occurred, or on the fact that change was enabled?
This is important especially when actions are nondeterministic.
<p>
In the Features and fluents tradition, we first used alternative (3)
(tech reports only), but then two group members, Tommy Persson and 
Lennart Staflin argued that (2) was the right way to go. Their paper at 
ECAI 1990, <b><font color="#005588">[c-ecai-90-497]</font></b>, uses (2) for characterizing indirect change. 
Their paper contains examples from continuous domains, but the formalism 
is also defined for, and applies equally well to the discrete case. 
(A revised version of the paper <b><font color="#005588">[r-linkoping-90-45]</font></b> extends the work)
In their approach, they wrote rules where the antecedent requires a 
specific fluent to actually have changed its value, but they also 
allowed to specify or to restrict the new or the old value. 
<p>
We were not alone, of course. The paper by del Val and Shoham at IJCAI '93,
<b><font color="#005588">[c-ijcai-93-732]</font></b> defines a predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>persistent</em><b>(<em>p</em>,&#160;<em>s</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> that is like 
the negation of
occludes, and an entailment method that (I believe) does chronological
minimization of unoccluded change. They mention the need for restrictions 
on the persistence axioms, but these are quite generous:

 and possibly past state of the database, not on future states...

things, and it would be interesting to hear what the history was there
(Murray? Rob?).

</em></font></td></tr></table>First, Fangzhen, if you felt I was being rough, I apologize, it was not
my intention. I don't know if it's worthwhile to go so deeply into this, 
but since you both ask the question let me summarize the background. 
As several authors are now using operators similar to the family of
occlude/ release/ persistent/ caused/ do/, a clarification of history may 
in fact be of some general interest. The following are the specific 
contributions of Fangzhen's 1995 paper <b><font color="#005588">[c-ijcai-95-1985]</font></b> according to 
its abstract:
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> ... we argue that normal state constraints that refer only to the
 truth values of fluents are not strong enough for [specifying the
 effects of actions using domain constraints], and that a notion of 
 causation needs to be employed explicitly.
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>See e.g. the Persson-Staflin paper <b><font color="#005588">[c-ecai-90-497]</font></b>. Several papers in
our group during 1988-1993 used a unique concept, "occlusion" or
"explanation" of change for several purposes: for imprecise timing
of changes within an action with extended duration, for nondeterminism, 
and also for "our intuition that a discontinuity should have a cause" 
(Persson/ Staflin). The abstract continues:
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> Technically, we introduce a new ternary predicate...

 statements]
<p>

<p>
Besides the material that is mentioned in the abstract, the paper 
also contains a section 4, which begins
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> The procedure we followed in solving the suitcase problem can be
 summarized as follows: ...
<p>

completion is enough to compute the intended conclusions. The KR'96
paper by Gustafsson and Doherty <b><font color="#005588">[c-kr-96-87]</font></b>
shows the striking similarity between 
this procedure and PMON. The procedure for reducing PMON to a first-order
formulation was described by Doherty and Lukaszewicz in their 
1994 ICTL paper <b><font color="#005588">[c-ictl-94-82]</font></b>, together
with similar reductions of all other entailment methods that were
assessed in "Features and Fluents" <b><font color="#005588">[mb-Sandewall-94]</font></b>. The generalization
of PMON to allowing fluent-based causal rules, is trivial. The
reduction also generalizes for rules of types 1 and 2 above. I believe
that Clark completion also has trouble with type 3?
<p>
We should of course not get enmeshed in priority debates, neither in this
Newsletter nor anywhere else. I do feel however that many papers in our
area get published with very incomplete accounts of previous and related 
work. This is unlikely to change because of the constraints that affect
us all: limitations on our time, and on the number of pages allowed
for each article. No reason to cast stones, therefore, but maybe the 
section on "related work" in research papers ought not to be our
only mechanism for assembling topic-specific surveys and bibliographies, 
and possibly the present debate forum could serve as a complement.
Additional contributions are invited to this account of recent history,
therefore.

<p>Vladimir,
<p>
I agree with you that the concept of `causality in terms of intervention
only' is too narrow (and Searle expresses it quite well!); 
I just think that most of the examples in common sense reasoning we are
currently dealing with are simple enough to be formalized in
`interventionistic' terms.
<p>
On the technical side, I do think there are some advantages in using 
the formalization one would obtain by translating the `reverse switches
domain' (example 5 in my paper) to the suitcase domain, i.e. using
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;(</b><em>holds</em><b><tt><sub><font size=+1>&#160;^&#160;</font></sub></tt></b><em>caused</em><b>)<tt>&#160;v&#160;</tt>(</b><em>caused</em><b><tt><sub><font size=+1>&#160;^&#160;</font></sub></tt></b><em>holds</em><b>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt></b><em>caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> instead of 
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>holds</em><b><tt><sub><font size=+1>&#160;^&#160;</font></sub></tt></b><em>holds</em><b><tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt></b><em>caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula>. 
<p>
These advantages are the same as those outlined for the switches domain
in my common sense paper (see example 5).
<p><font size=+1><a name="016">C1-7. </a><b><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~pdg">Peter Gr&uuml;nwald</a></b> (27.2):</font><p>
<p>Fangzhen,
<p>
First of all, let me apologize. I am very sorry to have insulted you
with my remarks. This was never my intention. Too eager to write a reply
quickly, I wrote it without thinking and I didn't realize that it would
be taken literally. 
<p>
In fact, I find your approach one of the most intuitive I have come
across; I think we both have quite similar intuitions about we are
modelling which makes it all the more silly to write `you don't know
what you're modelling'.  Here is what I really wanted to say; I hope
I'll be able to formulate it in a better way now:
<p>
`I think it is clearer what kind of situation can and what kind of
situation cannot be modeled with the help of the `Do' predicate (which
is intended to stand for interventions) than with the help of the
`Caused' predicate (which, if I understand you correctly, is intended
to be used in those situations in which we would use the <em>word</em> Caused
in natural language).'
<p>
Now that I'm at it, let me elaborate on this a little bit:
<p>
Though their roots are different (`Do' coming from Pearl's
structural equation theory and `Caused' coming from your work), 
it turns out that <em>formally</em> speaking, `Do' is almost the same as
your `Caused' : they are defined in very similar ways which
may even be equivalent (though this hasn't been proven). One of the
aims of (the long version of) my paper is to point this out. That it
may make sense to point it out can be seen from example 5 in the
paper (the `reversed switches domain', originally due to Sandewall
and/or Doherty, I believe). The Do-predicate occurs there
in the following axiom:
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=5%>&#160;</td><td width=80%><font color="#0000FF"><b><sub>&#160;</sub>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(</b><em>Light</em><b>(<em>t</em>),&#160;</b><em>TRUE</em><b>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(</b><em>Switch</em><b>(<em>t</em>),&#160;</b><em>TRUE</em><b>)&#160;</font></b>
</b></font></td><td width=15% align=right valign=top>(*)</td></tr>
</table>
(from the fact that the light has been put on we conclude that the
switch has been put in the on position)
<p>
If we describe to one another, in natural language, what is modelled
by this axiom, then we would probably not use any causal terms (does
putting on the light cause the switch to be on?)  (see the paper for
details). However, (*) can be modelled equally well by your
`caused'-predicate as with the `do'-predicate used here. It follows
that your `caused'-predicate has broader applicability than it might
seem, which I think is worth noting.

<p>
I am puzzled by your comments about Lin's predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> in
ENRAC 25.2.  In your view, it is an "exception operator," like
occlusion.  My understanding is very different.  Exception
operators are as old as formal default reasoning; McCarthy
called his exception operator <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Ab</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>, and its predecessor <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>End</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> can
be found in your paper written back in the 1970s.  Lin's
predicate <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula>, on the other hand, is a new and original idea.

is not present in the original formulation. Also, since Lin's paper does not
use any <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Ab</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> predicate (he minimizes <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> directly), translating
my formulation to one using <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Ab</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> doesn't particularly help the comparison. 
In fact, if you translate Lin's notation in the same way as you did for
mine, you will have to introduce an action variable there as well since 
your <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Ab</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> predicate is <em>defined</em> with that as its second argument. 
However, this has nothing to do with either Lin's formalism or mine.
<p>
The translation task is actually
very simple, since my formalism allows for both linear
time and branching time (F&amp;F page 138 ff). For branching time,
the notation <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;[<em>s</em>,&#160;<em>t</em>]&#160;</font></b></formula> is defined only if <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> is a direct or indirect
successor of <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>s</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>, and it then refers to the path from <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>s</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> to <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>.

(Remember that <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;[<em>t</em>]&#160;<em>p</em><tt>&#160;=&#160;</tt><em>v</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> is the same as <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>H</em>(<em>p</em>,&#160;<em>v</em>,&#160;<em>t</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula>, and that
this is a modified kind of equality, whose character can't be rendered 
in HTML). Both the informal explanation and the formal treatment of (1) 
and (2) are identical in the two approaches, for mainstream examples. 
Formula (2) is more compact, which is why I introduced the abbreviation
<table width=95%>

Then it's clear that the difference is purely notational. If you don't
want to represent the duration of actions, then you can of course modify
the abbreviation so that only one timepoint is mentioned.

3. Regarding the previous results of occlude that you mentioned:

<table border=0><tr><td width="8%">&#160;</td><td width="92%"><font color="green"><em> ... we argue that normal state constraints that refer only to the
 truth values of fluents are not strong enough for [specifying the

</em></font></td></tr></table><table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> 
 See e.g. the Persson-Staflin paper at ECAI 1990. Several papers in
 our group during 1988-1993 used a unique concept, "occlusion" or
 "explanation" of change for several purposes: for imprecise timing
 of changes within an action with extended duration, for nondeterminism, 
 and also for "our intuition that a discontinuity should have a cause" 
 (Persson/ Staflin). The abstract continues:
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>Observe that none of them were about domain (state) constraints and the
ramification problem. As you can see from the paragraph that you cited
from (Lin 95), the main contribution of my paper has to do with constraints 
and in particular causal constraints. If I'm not mistaken, the main 
impacts of the set of quite related papers on actions in IJCAI'95 have 
to do with the ramification problem. They shed some new lights on the
nature of this problem that had never before been thought of, and 
have just begun to bear fruits: for example, the work by Michael Thielsher
on diagnoses that was discussed in this newsletter before, and the
work on planning from causal theories using GSAT by Norm McCain and
Hudson Turner (in KR'98).
<p>
4. Regarding the connection between your PMON and the minimization strategy
that I used, yes, I'd be the first to admit that they are very similar. I
apologize for not knowing it earlier. Thinking back, it's not surprising how
they come together. As you know, I have been a devotee of what you call
"filtered preferential entailment" approach for as long as I can remember,
going back when Yoav and I were working on our provably correct theories of
actions.
<p>
The idea of minimizing <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Caused</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> with <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Holds</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> fixed was also straightforward
as it was the obvious one that would yield the Clark completion of
causal rules.
<p>
5. I enjoyed reading Gustafsson and Doherty's KR'96 paper. I learned a lot
from that paper. Patrick and I had some correspondences on the related
topics. I believe we found some common grounds, but none in terms of
"one can be reformulated in terms of another". (Patrick, correct me if
I'm wrong.) If anything, I wouldn't call PMON(RCs) a "trivial extension
of PMON to causal rules", especially when <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Occlude</em><b>&#160;</font></b></formula> is applied to a time 
point in PMON(RCs) while the same predicate is applied to a time interval 
in PMON. Many things are trivial in retrospect. (The idea of GSAT is so 
simple that Russell and Norvig even include it as an assignment in their 
AI textbook.) But in any event, this paper is more or less irrelevant as 
far as the history is concerned.
<p>
Last but not the least, Erik, I have all the respects and regards in the
world for you and your work! And Peter, there is no hard feeling whatsoever.

 (Murray? Rob?).
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>Now that the heat of the debate has died down a little, I would like to give 
a belated response.
<p>
The issue of ramifications and indirect effects is dealt with quite 
thoroughly in my book Solving the Frame Problem, especially in the context 
of the event calculus. (Incidentally, the book also deals extensively with 
the situation calculus, so it's not just an axe-grind for a particular 
formalism.) A large number of standard benchmark scenarios are discussed. 
These include the following.
<p>
<ul>

<li> The dead or alive scenario
<li> The walking turkey shoot
<li> The stuffy room scenario
<li> The chess board scenario (Reiter)
<li> The "safe from baby" scenario and
<li> the "wet in lake" scenario (Giunchiglia &amp; Lifschitz)
</ul>

<p>
I believe the treatment of these scenarios covers all the issues in the 
current debate. (One version of Thielscher's circuit example raises some 
interesting issues not covered in the book. But this example can be dealt 
with too.)
<p>
In particular, the event calculus formalism presented in the book 
incorporates a Releases predicate, much like Vladimir's releases predicate 
and Erik's occlusion, which exempts a fluent from the common sense law of 
inertia. (The intellectual debt is duly acknowledged in the book.) It also 
permits state constraints, such as
<p>
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=5%>&#160;</td><td width=80%><font color="#0000FF"><b><sub>&#160;</sub>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>HoldsAt</em><b>(</b><em>Alive</em><b>,&#160;<em>t</em>)<bf> if </bf></b><em>HoldsAt</em><b>(</b><em>Walking</em><b>,&#160;<em>t</em>)&#160;</font></b>
</b></font></td><td width=15% align=right valign=top>&#160;</td></tr>

<p>
as well as more "causal" constraints such as,
<p>
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=5%>&#160;</td><td width=80%><font color="#0000FF"><b><sub>&#160;</sub>

</b></font></td><td width=15% align=right valign=top>&#160;</td></tr>

<p>
If anyone has a scenario they think the book's formalism can't handle I'd 
like to hear from them.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> I do feel however that many papers in our

<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>I second that. I didn't devote years of my research time, as well as a lot 
of sweat and tears to writing that book for no-one to read it. (I know Erik 
sometimes feels the same way.) On my part, in the book, I tried very hard to 
give credit to others wherever appropriate, and to build on other's work 
rather than starting from scratch wherever I could.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td width="4%">&#160;</td><td width="96%"><font color="brown"><em> This is unlikely to change because of the constraints that affect
 us all: limitations on our time, and on the number of pages allowed

<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>I don't agree. We are all guilty of this to some degree, of course, and I 
tend to be generous in actual refereeing. But deep down I feel that an 
article that doesn't take scholarship seriously doesn't deserve to get 
published, in the same way that it wouldn't deserve to get published if it 
contained mathematical errors.

How can <formula></em></font><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>p</em>&#160;</font></b><font color="BROWN"><em></formula>
 change its value during an interval consisting of one time instant?
<p>
</em></font></td></tr></table>Consider a flash of lightning at night, during which a room is
instantaneously illuminated (<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>p</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>) for a single moment. The relevant predicate
changes its value twice during such an instant, if the instant is
considered to be like a point (having no duration), which seems quite
plausible. Even if you insist on making the flash into an interval by
separating the times of its beginning and ending, these times are both the
temporal locations of instantaneous changes in the illumination-predicate.
<p>
In fact, one can make a case that <em>any</em> change must involve instantanous
changes. Consider the classical example of two adjacent intervals meeting
at timepoint <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> (which in my favorite temporal logic is identical to the
interval <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;[<em>t</em>,&#160;<em>t</em>]&#160;</font></b></formula> ), and a light being switched on at <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>t</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>, so that 
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>p</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> - being
illuminated - becomes true at that timepoint. One might object that such an
apparently instantaneous change is in fact always really a continuous one
(the electricity begins to flow, the filament becomes hot and begins to
glow, etc.) and therefore occupies an non-instantaneous interval. But then
consider the beginning point $s$ of <em>that</em> interval, and consider the
property <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>q</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> of an illumination-change happening. The transition from not-<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>q</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>
to <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>q</em>&#160;</font></b></formula> is now instantaneous at <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>s</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>. Clearly, the same strategy is going to work
no matter how much you turn up the temporal magnification: there will
always be a first point of the relevant interval, and <em>something</em> will be
different there from the point immediately preceding.
<p>
For what its worth, by the way, this is one of the few places where quantum
physics seems to agree with naive intuition :-)

<p>As far as I have understood your approach, you do not use a causality
predicate (or connective), but rather you define a causality
relationship or causal implication by means of material implication as 
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(<em>p</em>,&#160;<em>b</em>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(<em>q</em>,&#160;<em>b</em><em>'</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> or <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>a</em><tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(<em>p</em>,&#160;<em>b</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula> 
as in example 3 
<p>
(6) <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>Do</em>(</b><em>Alive</em><b>(<em>t</em>),&#160;</b><em>false</em><b>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(</b><em>Walking</em><b>(<em>t</em>),&#160;</b><em>false</em><b>)&#160;</font></b></formula>

(3) <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Shoot</em><b><tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(</b><em>Alive</em><b>(<em>1</em>),&#160;</b><em>FALSE</em><b>)&#160;</font></b></formula>
<p>
But then you can derive classically, <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>A</em><tt><sub><font size=+1>&#160;^&#160;</font></sub></tt><em>Do</em>(<em>p</em>,&#160;<em>b</em>)<tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(<em>q</em>,&#160;<em>b</em><em>'</em>)&#160;</font></b></formula>, for any
formula <formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;<em>A</em>&#160;</font></b></formula>. In other words, your causality relation appears to be
<b>monotonic</b>. I think however  that  causal implication should be
<b>non-monotonic</b>. For example, from you axiom (3), you can derive
<p>
<formula><font color="#0000FF"><b>&#160;</b><em>Shoot</em><b><tt><sub><font size=+1>&#160;^&#160;</font></sub></tt></b><font size=+1>&#172;&#160;</font><b><em>-</em></b><em>loaded</em><b><tt>&#160;</tt>&#183;<tt>-&gt;&#160;</tt><em>Do</em>(</b><em>Alive</em><b>(<em>1</em>),&#160;</b><em>False</em><b>)&#160;</font></b></formula>
