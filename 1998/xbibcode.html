The bibliographic code used in the ACRES system and in many parts
of the present structure. These codes are used in a database
as carriers of information
about webpage(s) where the article can be found, article interaction
pages, links to database entries for the authors (in turn containing
links to their web pages), etc.
<p>
In a code such as <tt>c-fcs-98-42</tt>,
<tt>c</tt> stands for conferences,
<tt>fcs</tt> stands for Formalization of CommonSense reasoning,
<tt>98</tt> stands for 1998 (but it's 1998 internally, no millenium
   problems!), and
<tt>42</tt> stands for the the page number for the first page of the
   article in the workshop proceedings. (Though revised papers may
   have a different number of pages compared to the originals, we
   plan to keep these codes fixed anyway).
