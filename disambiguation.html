					<h2>Pronoun Disambiguation Problems</h2>
<div class="block">
<font size +2>
  <p>Following are two lists: one of sample Pronoun Disambiguation Problems (PDPs), and a list of the challenge PDPs used in the First Winograd Schema Challenge held at IJCAI 2016 . </p> 

<p>The passages are taken or modified from existing published works. The sample problems are taken from Carolyn Keene: <i>Nancy Drew: The Quest of the Missing Map</i>, Grosset & Dunlap, 1969, 1942; Jean de Brunhoff: <i>The Story of Babar</i>,  Random House, 1933; and  Anna Sewell: <i>Black Beauty</i>, J. M. Lupton, 1877. Sentences in WSC-2016 were taken from Laura Ingalls Wilder <i>Little Town on the Prarie</i>, P.G. Woodhouse: <i>Carry on, Jeeves </i>, Sidney Taylor: <i>All of a Kind Family</i>, Esther Forbes: <i>Johnny Tremaine</i>, Ruth Sawyer: <i>The Year of Jubilo</i>, and several other sources.

<p>
Sentences have been modified to summarize context and backstory, which are often given over several paragraphs, into a single sentence (PDP 33); to clarify or simplify (PDP 22); or to change gender or number of nouns and pronouns in order to introduce ambiguity (PDP 2). For challenge problems, character names were also changed. Note that a single passage may give rise to multiple Pronoun Disambiguation Problems.

<h3> Sample Pronoun Disambiguation Problems</h3>
<p>
 The pronoun to be disambiguated is highlighted in bold. It is repeated again, with a snippet of context, and with several candidate answers, in the line following the passage. The correct answer is given in the next line.</p>
