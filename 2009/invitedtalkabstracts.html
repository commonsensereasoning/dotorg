<b>Abstract:</b>
Crucial to the ultimate attainment of the goal of building an autonomous 
cognitive agent is endowing the agent with an ability to perceive, 
understand, formulate hypotheses and act based on the agent's perceptions. I 
will discuss work undertaken at Leeds in pursuit of this goal.  A key focus 
of our work is to integrate quantitative and qualitative modes of 
representation and to learn as much as possible from observation of the 
world, and thus to acquire high level symbolic models.  As one example of our 
approach, I will show how by characterising video sequences using a 
qualitative spatio-temporal relational descriptions, event classes can be 
mined, and in turn how a taxonomy of functional object categories can be 
induced from these event descriptions.

<b>Abstract:</b>
How should matter be conceptualized to best support commonsense reasoning
about simple physics and chemistry experiments?  To address the question,
we consider a sheaf of eleven benchmark physical concepts, rules, and
scenarios: Part/whole relations among bodies of matter; additivity of
mass; motion of a rigid solid object; continuous motion of fluids; fixed
mass proportions and spatial continuity at chemical reactions;
conservation of mass at chemical reactions; gasses in a container
attaining equilibrium; the ideal gas law and the law of partial pressures;
liquid at rest in an open container; carrying liquid in an open container;
the constant availability of oxygen for reactions in an atmosphere; and
surface passivization of metals.  We then present a number of different
ontologies and representational schemes: the model of atoms and molecules
with statistical mechanics; models of spatio-temporal fields, with either
points, regions, or histories; models of continuous moving material in
terms of chunks of matter, with or without point particles; and a hybrid
theory that combines atoms and molecules, chunks of matter, and continuous
fields using each where appropriate.  We evaluate each of the
representational schemes in terms of the ease of representing the
benchmark problems and other features. Overall, the field model with
histories and hybrid model seem to be best, though neither is
unproblematic.  We conclude by discussing the major challenges for
extending this work.

Abstract:
</b>
In 1987, Ray Reiter proposed a logical characterization of diagnosis
from first principles that has had significant influence on the study
of diagnostic problem solving.  Together with de Kleer and Mackworth
he extended this characterization in 1992.  Since that time there
have been several attempts to build on his fundamental work by
creating a characterization of diagnosis of dynamical systems.
In this talk, we revisit Reiter's original work on diagnosis, as
well as more recent work on diagnosis of dynamical systems. We
discuss potential shortcomings of this more recent work, and
propose a more general formulation of dynamical diagnosis together
with some associated computational machinery.
