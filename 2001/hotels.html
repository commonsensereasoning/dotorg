Note from David Randell: <br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We booked with the Pioneer Hotel in Little Italy; rates much cheaper and
there is availability, e.g. double with private facilities for $89-$99
including tax!  It may be a bit too basic, but the on-line reviews were OK -
i.e. clean rooms, seemed a relatively safe area and apparently happy
customers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I (Ernie) haven't checked it out myself, but I would say that this is a 
somewhat grungier area than most of the other listings, but, as David says,
it should be quite safe.
