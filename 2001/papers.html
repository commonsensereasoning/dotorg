<b>Title:</b>        LiSA: A Robot Driven by Logical Subsumption <br>
<b> Full paper <A href="final/amir.ps"> Postscript </A> /
<A href="final/amir.pdf"> PDF </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
  This paper describes an implemented robot-control system that is
  based on Brooks-style subsumption [Brooks86] of logical
  theories.  It implements Brooks-style subsumption between layers
  using nonmonotonic reasoning.  We describe the control and reasoning
  algorithms and some of the experiments that we did with the system,
  running on a Nomad200 robot and a set of computers.  Our
  experimental study shows that commonsense theories and
  general-purpose first-order logic theorem provers can be used to
  control real-time agents and robots in particular.
  Our system improves over traditional subsumption
  systems in several ways. It allows the user to send new axioms to
  each of the layers as the robot is running, allowing the user to
  give advice to the robot and to correct behaviors in runtime. Our
  system has no voting scheme for deciding on the behavior that should
  be followed. Instead, the layers work in synergy to provide the
  compound behavior.
  Our system improves over other robot-control systems that are based
  on logic in that it allows full first-order expressivity and that it
  is fully declarative.

<b>Title:</b> Reasoning about actions in a probabilistic setting <br>
<b> <A href="final/baral.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  In this paper we present a language to reason about
actions in a probabilistic setting and compare our work with earlier work
by Pearl and (also briefly with) representations used in probabilistic
planning.  The main feature of out language is its use of static
and dynamic causal laws and use of unknown (or background) variables --
whose values are determined by factors beyond our model -- in incorporating
probabilities.  We also incorporate probabilities in reasoning with narratives.

<b>Title:</b> Causal Counterfactuals <br>
<b> Full paper <A href="final/bell.ps"> Postscript </A> /
<A href="final/bell.pdf"> PDF </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
The formal possible-worlds analysis of counterfactuals has tended to
concentrate on their semantics and logic, with their pragmatics being
given informally. However, if counterfactuals are to be of use in
Artificial Intelligence, it is necessary to
provide formal pragmatics for them. This is done in this paper
by combining work on the representation of common sense reasoning
about events with an appropriate  semantics for counterfactuals.
The resulting combination provides a  unified framework for
formal reasoning about actual and counterfactual events.

<b>Title:</b> : Weakening Conflicting Information for Iterated Revision and Knowledge  <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
 The ability to handle exceptions, to perform iterated belief
revision and to
integrate information from multiple sources are essential skills for an
intelligent agent. These important skills are related in the sense that they
all  rely on resolving inconsistent information.
We develop a novel and useful strategy for conflict resolution, and compare
and contrast it with existing strategies. Ideally the process of conflict
resolution should conform with the principle of  Minimal Change and should
result in the <em>minimal loss</em> of information. Our approach to
minimizing the loss of information is to weaken information involved in
conflicts rather than completely removing it.  We implemented and tested the
relative performance of our new strategy in three different ways. We show
that it retains more information than the existing Maxi-Adjustment strategy
at no extra computational cost. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate
that it provides a computationally effective compilation of the
lexicographical strategy, a strategy which is
known to have desirable theoretical properties. <br>

<b>Title:</b>   A negotiation-style framework for non-prioritised revision
<br>
<b> <A href="final/booth.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We present a framework for non-prioritised belief revision ---
i.e., belief revision in which newly acquired information is not
always fully accepted --- in which the result of revision
is arrived at via a kind of negotiation between old
information and new. We show how both ordinary partial meet
revision and Ferme and Hansson's selective revision can be captured in
this framework, and also how it supports the definition
of contraction operators which do not necessarily satisfy the
basic AGM contraction postulate of (Success). <br>

<b> Title: </b> Symbolic Dynamic Programming for First-Order MDP's <br>
<b> <A href="final/boutilier.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> We present a dynamic programming approach for
the solution of first-order Markov decision processes. This
technique uses an MDP whose dynamics are represented in a variant of
the situation calculus allowing for stochastic actions. It produces
a <em>logical description</em> of the optimal value function and
policy by constructing a set of first-order formulae that <em> minimally
</em> partition state space according to distinctions made by the value 
function and policy.  This is achieved through the use of an operation
known as <em> decision-theoretic regression.</em> In effect, our algorithm
performs value iteration without explicit enumeration of either the state
or action spaces of the MDP.  This allows problems involving relational
fluents and quantification to be solved without requiring explicit 
state space enumeration or conversion to propositional form.

<b>Abstract:</b> 
Continuity from a qualitative perspective is different from both the
philosophical and mathematical view of continuity. We explore different
intuitive notions of spatio-temporal continuity. We present a general
formal framework for continuity and continuous
transitions in mereotopology for spatio-temporal histories and thus
sketch the correctness of the conceptual neighbourhood for the

<b> Title: </b> Computing Strongest Necessary and Weakest Sufficient
Conditions of First-Order Formulas. <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> A technique is proposed for computing the weakest sufficient (wsc)
and strongest necessary (snc) conditions for formulas in an
expressive fragment of first-order logic using quantifier
elimination techniques. The efficacy of the approach is
demonstrated by using the techniques to compute snc's and wsc's
for use in agent communication applications, theory approximation
and generation of abductive hypotheses. Additionally, we
generalize recent results involving the generation of successor
state axioms in the propositional situation calculus via snc's
to the first-order case. Subsumption results for existing
approaches to this problem and a re-interpretation of the concept
of "forgetting" as a process of quantifier elimination are
also provided. <br>

<b>Title:</b>  The Role of Dialogue in Cooperative Problem Solving
<br>
<b> <A href="final/keplicz.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Though communication is a vital ingredient of Computer
Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) as well as Cooperative Problem Solving
(CPS) in multiagent system (MAS), the in-depth analysis of different
types of communication has been missing in MAS literature.  This paper
presents an investigation into the role the specific types of dialogue
play during consecutive stages of CPS in BDI systems, i.e. <em> potential
recognition, team formation, plan formation, and team action. </em>
The relevant dialogue types are: <em> persuasion, negotiation, inquiry,
deliberation, </em> and <em> information seeking </em>.  In the present
paper informal characterizations of these types are presented.

<b>Title:</b>   Diagnosing failures and predicting safe runs in robot control
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We present a formal framework for diagnosing failures and
   predicting safe runs of actions, given incomplete  information
  on the initial state of affair, i.e. on the initial database
   providing a description of the domain before any action has
   taken place. Two aspects of uncertainty are
  formalized by two different notions of probability:
   uncertainty in the  initial database
and uncertainty during  the execution of a course of actions.
We introduce also a third concept of probability, which is
  obtained by combining the two previous notions. We call this new
   concept expected probability: it
  accounts for the probability of a sentence on the hypothesis that the
  sequence of actions needed to make it true might have
  failed. This new probability can be used
 to predict what would happen after a given course of
 actions; it leads to the possibility of comparing courses of
   actions and verifying which one is more safe.
 On the  other hand, after a course of actions has been executed, and
   failures might have occurred, we give a methodology to diagnose what
   had really happened during the execution. <br>

<b>Title:</b> Reasoning about Categories in Conceptual Spaces <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
 Understanding the process of categorization is a primary research
goal in artificial
intelligence.  The conceptual space framework provides a flexible approach
to modeling
context-sensitive categorization via a geometrical representation designed
for modeling
and managing concepts.

<p>
In this paper we show how algorithms developed in computational geometry,
and the Region
Connection Calculus can be used to model important aspects of categorization
in
conceptual spaces. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of using
existing
geometric algorithms to build and manage categories in conceptual spaces,
and we show
how the Region Connection Calculus can be used to reason about categories
and other
conceptual regions. <br>

<b>Title:</b> The Representational Requirements of Strategic Planning <br>
<b> <A href="final/Gordon.pdf"> Full paper (PDF) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
An analysis of strategies, recognizable abstract patterns of planned behavior,
reveals an enormous divide between the kind of planning that artificial
intelligence planning systems do and the kind of strategic planning that
people do.  This paper describes a project to collect and represent
strategies on a large scale to identify the representational requirements
of strategic planning in order to inform the design of futhre artificial
intelligence planning systems.  Three hundred and seventy-two strategies were
collected from ten different planning domains.  Each was represented at
an abstract level and in a preformal manner designed to reveal the planning
concepts that each strategy contains.  The contents of these representations,
consisting of nearly one thousand unique planning concepts, were then 
collected and organized into forty-eight groups that outline the 
representational and functional components of strategic planning systems.

<b>Title:</b>  Belief Update in the pGolog Framework <br>
<b> <A href="final/grosskreutz.pdf"> Full paper (PDF) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
High-level controllers that operate robots in dynamic, uncertain domains
are concerned with at least two reasoning tasks dealing with the effects
of noisy sensors and effectors: They have a) to project the effects of a
candidate plan and b) to update their beliefs during on-line execution of
a plan.  In this paper, we show how the pGolog framework, which in its
original form only accounted for the projection of high-level plans, can
be extended to reason about the way the robot's beliefs evolve during the
on-line execution of a plan.  pGolog, an extension of the high-level
programming language GOLOG, allows the specification of probabilistic
beliefs about the state of the world and the representation of sensors and
effectors which have uncertain, probabilistic outcomes.  As an application
of belief update, we introduce belief-based programs, GOLOG-style programs
whose tests appeal to the agent's beliefs at execution time.

<b>Title:</b>   Elaboration Tolerance through Object-Orientation <br>
<b> <A href="final/kvarnstrom.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
 Although many formalisms for reasoning about action and change
      have been proposed in the literature, their semantic adequacy
      has primarily been tested using tiny domains that highlight some
      particular aspect or problem.  However, since some of the
      classical problems are completely or partially solved and since
      powerful tools are available, it is now necessary to start
      modeling more complex domains.  This paper presents a
      methodology for handling such domains in a systematic manner
      using an object-oriented framework and provides several examples
      of the elaboration tolerance exhibited by the resulting models.

<b> Title: </b> Causality <br>
<b> <A href="final/hobbs.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> We do things in the world by exploiting our
knowledge of what causes what.  But in trying to reason formally about
causality, there is a difficulty: to reason with certainty, we need
complete knowledge of all the relevant events and circumstances, whereas
in everyday reasoning tasks we need a more serviceable but looser notion
that does not make such demands on our knowledge.  In this work I introduce
the notion of "causal complex" for a complete set of events and conditions
necessary for the causal consequent to occur, and use the term "cause" for the
makeshift, nonmonotonic notion we require for everyday tasks such as planning
and natural langauge understanding.  I discuss the issue of how to distinguish
between what is in a causal complex from what is outside it, and within
a causal complex, how to distinguishy the eventualities that deserve to be 
called "causes" from those that do not, in particular circumstances. In
addition, I discuss some general properties of causality, such as transitivity,
and how related notions such as "prevent", "enable", and "maintain" can be
defined in terms of "cause".

<b> <A href="final/horty.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
The purpose of this paper is to question some commonly accepted
patterns of reasoning involving nonmonotonic logics that generate
multiple extensions.  In particular, I argue that the phenomenon of
floating conclusions indicates a problem with the view that the
skeptical consequences of such theories should be identified with the
statements that are supported by each of their various extensions.

<b>Title: </b>A Circumscriptive Formalization of the
Qualification Problem <br>


<b>Abstract:</b>
The qualification problem refers to  the difficulty
that arises in
formalizing actions, because it is difficult or
impossible to specify
in advance all the  preconditions that should hold
before an action
can be executed. We study
the qualification problem in the setting of the
situation calculus and
give a simple formalization using nested abnormality
theories, a
formalism based on circumscription. The formalization
that we present
allows us to combine a solution to the frame problem
with a solution
to the qualification problem. <br>

<b> Title: </b> Theorem Proving with Structured Theories  <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
Motivated by the problem of query answering over multiple structured
commonsense theories, we exploit graph-based techniques to improve the
efficiency of theorem proving for structured theories.  Theories are
organized into subtheories that are minimally connected by the
literals they share.  We present message-passing algorithms that
reason over these theories using consequence finding, specializing our
algorithms for the case of first-order resolution, and for batch and
concurrent theorem proving.  We provide an algorithm that restricts
the interaction between subtheories by exploiting the polarity of
literals.  We attempt to minimize the reasoning within each individual
partition by exploiting existing algorithms for focused incremental
and general consequence finding.  Finally, we propose an algorithm
that compiles each subtheory into one in a reduced sublanguage.
We have proven the soundness and completeness of all of these
algorithms. <br>

<b> Title: </b> Adapting Golog for Programming the Semantic Web <br>
<b> <A href="final/mcilraith-son2.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
Motivated by the problem of automatically composing network accessible
services, such as those on the World Wide Web, this paper proposes an
approach to building agent technology based on the notion of generic 
procedures and customizing user constraint.  We argue that an augmented version
of the logic programming language Golog provides a natural formalism for
programming Web services.  To this end, we adapt and extend the Golog 
language to enable programs that are generic, customizable, and usable
in the context of the Web.  We realize these extensions in an augmented
ConGolog interpreter that combines online execution of information-providing
Web services with offline simulation of world-altering Web services,
to determine a sequence of Web Services for subsequent execution.  Our
implemented system is currently interacting with services on the Web.

<b> Title: </b>  Context-sensitive merging <br>
<b> <A href="final/meyer.ps"> Full paper (Postscript)  </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
Intelligent agents have to be able to merge (possibly conflicting)
pieces of information obtained from different sources to produce a
coherent picture of the world. In this paper we propose a model for
context-sensitive merging. We show that the success of the model
depends, to a large extent, on the availability of suitable merging
operations on epistemic states; structures in the spirit of Spohn (1988).
As a result, we investigate the link between such merging operations and
the aggregation operations studied in social choice theory (Arrow,
1963). We show that Arrow's impossibility result disappears when recast
into the framework that we employ.

<b> Title: </b> From Images to Bodies: Modelling and Exploiting Spatial 
Occlusion and Motion Parallax  <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
This paper describes the Region Occlusion Calculus (ROC-20), that can be
used to model spatial occlusion and the effects of motion parallax of
arbitrary shaped objects.  ROC-20 assumes the region based ontology of RCC-8
and extends Galton's Lines of Sight Calculus by allowing concave shaped
objects into the modelled domain. This extension is used to describe the
effects of mutually occluding bodies. The inclusion of van Benthem's
axiomatization of comparative nearness facilitates reasoning about relative
distances between occluding bodies. Further, an envisionment table is
developed to model sequences of occlusion events enabling reasoning about
objects and their images formed in a changing visual field. <br>

<b> Title: </b> Automated Answers to Questions about a Running Process <br>
<b> <A href="final/sabouret.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
We propose here a formal model and a classification of the questions
that a human user can ask about the actions, behaviour and activity of
an active component. The components are described using a specific
language and have access at runtime to a formal specification of their
actions and current states. We present a formal model for requests about
actions based on the combination of speech acts and procedural types
that determines the answering mechanism. We also study some procedural
problems raised by the formalisation of such common sense questions.
Eventually, we show some examples of questions represented in our
request model.

<b> Abstract: </b> 
This paper introduces the notion of heuristic

This approach is compared with some heuristic

The heuristic information and declarative

<b> <A href="final/soutchanski.ps"> Full paper (Postscript) </A> </b> <br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
The paper compares an approach to reasoning about effects of 
actions, knowledge, and sensing that relies on epistemic fluent 
(and reduces reasoning about knowledge to provability)
to another approach that does not rely on epistemic fluents and 
suggests to account for effects of sense actions directly in 
successor state axioms. It is shown that under certain assumptions 
these two approaches are essentially equivalent. The second approach 
is used in a high level program that controls a mobile robot.
