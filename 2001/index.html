<p>
To endow computers with common sense is one of the major long term goals
of Artificial Intelligence research. Although we know how to build programs 
that excel at certain bounded or mechanical tasks which humans find difficult, 
such as playing chess, we have very little idea how to program computers to 
do well at commonsense tasks which are easy for humans.  One approach to this
problem is to formalize commonsense reasoning using mathematical logic.  
This will be the focus of the symposium.

<p>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>change, action, and causality
<li>ontologies, including space, time, shape, and matter,
     and ontologies of networks and structures
<li>levels of granularity of ontology and reasoning
<li>large commonsense knowledge bases (including work related to the HPKB (High Performance Knowledge Bases) project 
and  the RKF (Rapid Knowledge Formation) project)
<li>axiomatizations of benchmark commonsense problems  
(see 
<A HREF="http://www.ida.liu.se/ext/etai/lmw/">the Logic Modelling  Workshop</A> and
<A HREF="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/cs/">the Common Sense 
Problem Page</A> for examples)
<li>exploration of new commmonsense domains in a preformal way: e.g., discussion of new microworlds, benchmark problems, or "drosophila"
<li>non-monotonic reasoning
<li>formal models of probabilistic reasoning
<li>formal theories of context
<li>mental attitudes including knowledge, belief, intention, and planning
<li>belief change, update, and revision
<li>cognitive robotics
<li>reasoning about multi-agent systems and social interactions among agents
<li>applications of formal representations to applications, such as natural language processing
<li>other mathematical tools for capturing common sense reasoning
</ul>

<p>
The symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied the 
formalization of common sense reasoning.  The focus of the symposium is 
on representation rather than on algorithms, and on formal rather than 
informal methods.  Papers should be rigorous and concrete.  While mathematical
logic is expected to be the primary lingua franca of the symposium, 
we also welcome papers using a rigorous but not logic-based representation
of commonsense domains.

<p>
Technical papers offering new results in the  area are especially welcome;
object level theories as opposed to meta-level results are preferred.  However, 
survey papers, papers studying the relationship between different approaches, 
and papers on methodological issues such as theory evaluation, 
are also encouraged.

<p>
Persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit 
papers of up to 
6000 words, excluding the bibliography.   Electronic submissions, either in 
postscript or 
pdf, are preferred; otherwise 6 hard copies of the paper are acceptable.  
Persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1-2 page research 
summary 
including a list of relevant publications.    All submissions and requests 
for attendance should be sent to Ernest Davis or Leora Morgenstern, 
at the addresses below.

<b>Submission deadline:</b>        February 1, 2001
<br>
<b>Notification of acceptance:</b> March 27, 2001
<br>
<b>Final papers due:</b>           April 23, 2001

<b>Symposium:</b>                   May 20-22, 2001                                     

<H3> <A Name="Publication">  Publication </A> </H3>
Final papers will be posted on the Commonsense-2001 website. Several
journals have expressed interest in publishing a special issue consisting
of extended versions of selected papers of Commonsense-2001.  Once
an agreement has been reached with one of these, the program
chairs will invite selected authors to submit extended versions of their
papers for the special journal issue. 

<H3> <A Name="Multiple">  Multiple Submissions Allowed</A> </H3>
Papers may be submitted to Commonsense-2001 even if they have been
submitted to other conferences or symposia (such as IJCAI-2001), because
the Commonsense-2001 website is not archival.  If a paper is accepted
at an archival conference such as IJCAI and also presented at 
Commonsense-2001, this paper must be substantially revised and/or extended
before being submitted to the special journal issue.  Previously published
papers are not acceptable for Commonsense-2001.
