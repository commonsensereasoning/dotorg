<h2><font color="#808000">Call for Papers</font></h2>

<p>
One of the major long-term goals of artificial intelligence is to endow
computers with commonsense reasoning capabilities. Although we know how to
design and build systems that excel at certain bounded or mechanical tasks
which humans find difficult, such as playing chess, we have little idea how
to construct computer systems that do well at commonsense tasks which are
easy for humans.
</p>

<p>
Formalizing commonsense reasoning using logic-based approaches will be the
focus of the symposium. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
change, action, and causality
</li>
<li>
self-aware systems
</li>
<li>
axiomatizations of benchmark commonsense problems
</li>
<li>
ontologies, including space, time, shape, and matter, and ontologies
of networks and structures
</li>
<li>
levels of granularity of ontology and reasoning
</li>
<li>
large commonsense knowledge bases
</li>
<li>
exploration of new commonsense domains in a preformal way (e.g. new
microworlds or benchmark problems)
</li>
<li>
nonmonotonic reasoning
</li>
<li>
formal models of probabilistic reasoning
</li>
<li>
formal theories of context
</li>
<li>
mental attitudes including knowledge, belief, intention, and planning
</li>
<li>
belief revision, update, and merging
</li>
<li>
cognitive robotics
</li>
<li>
reasoning about multi-agent systems and social interactions among agents
</li>
<li>
applications of formal representations to applications, such as
natural
language processing
</li>
<li>
other mathematical tools for capturing common sense reasoning<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The symposium aims to bring together researchers who have
studied the formalization of commonsense reasoning. The focus of the symposium is on
representation rather than on algorithms, and on formal rather than
informal methods. Papers should be rigorous and concrete. Technical papers offering
new results in the area are especially welcome; object level theories are
preferred. We especially encourage papers on either of the two themes of
this symposium, Self-awareness and the Surprise Birthday Present Problem
(see below). Survey papers, papers studying the relationship between
different approaches, and papers on methodological issues such as theory
evaluation, are also encouraged.
</p>
<br>

<h4>Symposium Themes</h4>

<p>
There will be two special
themes at this year's CommonSense 2005. In addition
to the topics listed above, we
encourage papers on these two themes, and plan to organize one or more
panels on these topics.
</p>

<p>
The first theme is <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/DWSAS-statements.html"
target="_blank">Self-awareness</a>: the notion of the computer having a
sense of self, being conscious of its own reasoning power, and being able
to explore itself in relation to other agents. We are
especially interested in formal theories that represent
self-awareness, and/or allow a
system to reason about its own awareness.
</p>

<p>
The second theme is the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/#surprisebirthday"
target="_blank">Surprise Birthday Present Problem</a>, one
of the challenge problems on the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/"
target="_blank">Common Sense Problem Page</a>. We encourage
submission of papers that present solutions to this problem and to its
listed variants.  Sample solutions to other challenge problems can be found on the Common Sense
Problem Page.
</p>
<br>

<h4>Submission Information</h4>

<p>
Persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers
of up to 6000 words, excluding the bibliography. Electronic submissions in
pdf, are preferred; otherwise 6 hard copies of the paper are acceptable.
Paper submission should be sent to <a href="info.html#pc" target="info">Michael Thielscher</a>.
Electronic submissions should be sent to

<br>

<h4>Publication</h4>

<p>
The proceedings of the symposium will be published as a
Dresden University Technical Report (ISSN 1430-211X). 
Moreover, the program chairs
will invite selected authors to submit extended versions of their papers
for a special issue of the <a href="http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/list/logcom/"
target="_blank">Journal of Logic and Computation</a>.
</p>
<br>


<h4>Multiple Submissions Allowed</h4>

<p>
Papers may be submitted to Commonsense-2005 even if they have been submitted
to other conferences or symposia (such as IJCAI-2005). If a
paper is accepted at an archival conference such as IJCAI and is also
selected by Commonsense-2005 for publication at the special journal issue,
then this paper must be substantially revised and/or extended. Previously
published papers are not acceptable for Commonsense-2005.
</p>
<br>


<h4>Participation</h4>

<p>
Persons wishing to attend the symposium should submit a 1-2 page
research summary including a list of relevant publications. This is not
required for the authors of submitted papers. Moreover PhD students
need only to send the tentative title and abstract of their dissertation.
All requests for attendance should be sent to
<a href="info.html#pc" target="info">Michael Thielscher</a>.
